While firewalls, antivirus, and EDR systems are essential, they are primarily reactive — they wait for a known \u0026ldquo;signature\u0026rdquo; or alert to trigger. Sophisticated attackers know how to evade these triggers. By leveraging threat hunting capabilities, an organization can proactively find hidden attackers and advanced threats that bypass automated defenses, thus reducing dwell time, identifying security gaps, and disrupting adversary activity. Threat hunting is driven by an assumption of breach, which means operating under the premise that an adversary already has a foothold within a network.\nCore Concepts and Terminology\rReactive vs. Proactive\rWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with terms I\u0026rsquo;ve already mentioned several times - reactive vs. proactive.\nIncident response, in general, is italics textreactiveitalics text:\nAction is triggered by an alert/incident Relies on known signatures, rules, or other predefined detection logic Effective for known/commodity threats; limited for novel or low-and slow This would be akin to receiving a home security alert about an intruder in your home and then investigating. Threat hunting, on the other hand, is italics textproactiveitalics text:\nAction is initiated by an analyst\u0026rsquo;s hypotheses Seeks unknown/evasive threats - finding a needle in a needle stack Focuses on attacker behavior and tradecraft rather than signatures Ultimately improves detection logic/telemetry/security posture over time This would be akin to italics textsuspectingitalics text an intruder is in your home without receiving a security alert and going to check. The Pyramid of Pain\rThis model was created by David Bianco and provides a great visualization of the increasing difficulty adversaries face when you deny them certain indicators.\nThe pyramid works its way up from lowest to highest impact. At the bottom half of the pyramid we have hash values, IP addresses, and domain names, all of which are rather inconsequential for an attacker to change. Threat hunting aims to operate at the top of the pyramid, focusing on adversary TTPs and actually disrupting how they operate. This causes the most \u0026ldquo;pain\u0026rdquo; for adversaries by forcing them to change their behaviors.\n###IOCs vs IOAs\nThis is a crucial concept to understand. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many junior hunters, or analysts seeking to transition from IR to hunting, struggle with this.\nbold textIndicators of compromise (IOCs)bold text are artifacts that suggest a breach has already happened and typically spur an incident response. These indicators are easy for adversaries to change and are typically only discovered post-compromise.\nExamples include:\nMalicious IPs or domains Malicious file hashes Known bad registry keys bold textIndicators of attack (IOAs)bold text focus on behavior associated with an active attack in progress or an emerging attack. Focusing on the behaviors associated with an attack make it harder for attackers to evade, and can even be effective in combating zero-days or custom tooling that would bypass signature detection.\nExamples include:\nCredential dumping from LSASS Abnormal parent-child process relationships Execution of unsigned modules from memory ###MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK Framework\nitalics textEveryitalics text threat hunter should be intimately familiar with the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework. This incredible knowledge base catalogs adversary behavior across tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques. Tactics provide the italics textwhyitalics text of an action, such as initial access or persistence. Techniques and sub-techniques provide italics texthowitalics text a tactic is achieved, such as process injection or command and scripting interpreter. This framework is crucial for threat hunters because we frequently use it to structure a hypothesis. For instance, suppose we know an adversary of interest has a tendency to achieve credential access by targeting credentials stored in the process memory of the LSASS. T1003.001 - OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory would provide a starting point.\n##Threat Hunting Methodologies\nNow that we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed how the pyramid of pain, IOAs, and the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework fit into threat hunting, let\u0026rsquo;s go over some different hunting methodologies. There are various approaches, and while no one way is \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo;, mature threat hunting teams will blend all them all.\n###Hypothesis-Driven Hunting\nThis is creative and more mature approach to threat hunting. It begins with a question or a theory about a potential attack vector or adversary behavior. For example, you suspect/hypothesize that an attacker is abusing WMI to move laterally within your environment. You may then start to investigate for instances of WmiPrvSE.exe spawning cmd.exe or powershell.exe.\n###Intelligence-Driven Hunting\nThis method is driven by external reporting, translating threat intelligence into behavioral queries. For example, if a recent report states that a specific APT is modifying registry key values to establish persistence, this could spur a hunt that searches for modification of the specific key.\n###Data-Driven/Machine Learning-Driven Hunting\nThese hunts use data science to identify anomalies. It requires appropriate baselining to establish \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; behavior, and then investigating statistical outliers - such as thin-tailed and fat-tailed distribution. For example, spikes in outbound traffic could be indicative of data exfiltration.\n##Threat Hunt Lifecycle\nThreat hunting is not random; it\u0026rsquo;s actually a structured, repeatable lifecycle.\nHypothesis Development The hunt begins with some sort of trigger to generate a testable hypothesis; this could be a newly reported vulnerability, a new technique added to MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK, or even a gut feeling based on recent trends.\nData Collection After forming a hypothesis, we must determine that the necessary data actually exists to test the hypothesis. For instance, we must identify the relevant telemetry sources: do we ingest EDR logs? Do we have Windows Event Logs? Do we have PCAP or NetFlow data? The necessary data must exist in order to conduct a hunt.\nAnalysis and Investigation Once we\u0026rsquo;ve identified the necessary data, we being to query and pivot. As we work through the data, we must validate our findings and filter out known-good behavior to identify and isolate malicious activity. As an example, if we are running a search and observe that svchost.exe appears 1,000 times, but svch0st.exe appears once, we need to identify and investigate that anomaly.\n","date":"2025-12-16T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/post/threat-hunting-101/ThreatHunting101_hu_64645a2448f2b2f6.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/threat-hunting-101/","title":"Threat Hunting 101"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\nHeadings\rThe following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1\rH2\rH3\rH4\rH5\rH6\rParagraph\rXerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
